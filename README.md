# Heart_Disease_Prediction_Dashboard
 This Python project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) to predict heart disease based on patient data using machine learning algorithms like KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The predictions, along with evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, are displayed in a simple interface built using Tkinter.

## Features
- **User-friendly interface**: A simple GUI allows users to enter patient data such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more.
- **Machine learning models**: Supports five algorithms: KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
- **Performance metrics**: Displays model evaluation metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score for each prediction.
- **Prediction table**: Results are shown in a table with all evaluation scores for easy comparison.

## Technologies Used
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and loading from CSV files.
- **numpy**: Handling numerical operations and input scaling.

## How to Use
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
